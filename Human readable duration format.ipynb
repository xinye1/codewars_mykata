    "Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns \"now\". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is much easier to understand with an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "  format_duration(62)    # returns \"1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n",
    "  format_duration(3662)  # returns \"1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "Note that spaces are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed rules\n",
    "\n",
    "* The resulting expression is made of components like `4 seconds`, `1 year`, etc. In general, a positive integer and one of the valid units of time, separated by a space. The unit of time is used in plural if the integer is greater than 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The components are separated by a comma and a space (`\", \"`). Except the last component, which is separated by `\" and \"`, just like it would be written in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A more significant units of time will occur before than a least significant one. Therefore, `1 second and 1 year` is not correct, but `1 year and 1 second` is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Different components have different unit of times. So there is not repeated units like in `5 seconds and 1 second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A component will not appear at all if its value happens to be zero. Hence, `1 minute and 0 seconds` is not valid, but it should be just `1 minute`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A unit of time must be used \"as much as possible\". It means that the function should not return `61 seconds`, but `1 minute and 1 second` instead. Formally, the duration specified by of a component must not be greater than any valid more significant unit of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the purpose of this Kata, a year is 365 days and a day is 24 hours."

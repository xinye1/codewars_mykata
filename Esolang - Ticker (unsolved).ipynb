    "_NOTE: It is recommended you complete Introduction to [Esolangs](https://www.codewars.com/kata/esolang-interpreters-number-1-introduction-to-esolangs-and-my-first-interpreter-ministringfuck/) or MiniBitFlip before solving this one._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make an interpreter for an esoteric language called Ticker. Ticker is a descendant of Tick. Your language has the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `>`: increment the selector by 1\n",
    "* `<`: decrement the selector by 1\n",
    "* `*`: add the ascii value of selected cell to the output tape\n",
    "* `+`: increment selected cell data by 1. If 256, then it is 0\n",
    "* `-`: increment selected cell data by -1. If less than 0, then 255\n",
    "* `/`: set selected cell data to 0\n",
    "* `!`: add new data cell to the end of the array\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with selector at `0` and one cell with a value of `0`. If selector goes out of bounds, assume 0 for that cell but do not add it to the memory. If a + or - is being made do not change the value of the assumed cell. It will always stay 0 unless it is added to the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words:\n",
    "```\n",
    "data: start 0 end\n",
    "selector:   ^\n",
    "data start 1 2 4 end\n",
    "selector:        ^\n",
    "Assume that cell is zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following program:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*/'\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's output is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Hello World!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is made just by using 1 data cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using multiple data cells:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "And it's output is still:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Hello World!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++**!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<*>>!>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*<<<<*!>>>>>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*!>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++*'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Which still returns the classic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Hello World!'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other characters are ingnored and therefore can serve as comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you're done, fell free to make translations and to discuss this kata."
